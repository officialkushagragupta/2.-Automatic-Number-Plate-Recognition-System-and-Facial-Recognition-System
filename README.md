The proposed OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model is designed to accurately detect license plates from images and is optimized. This projext was made during Kavach Intra College Hackathon'23.

The model employs a deep learning-based approach that integrates computer vision and natural language processing techniques to extract the text information from the license plate. The model utilizes a state-ofthe-art object detection algorithm to identify the license plate's location within the image, followed by a character recognition module that accurately extracts the alphanumeric characters from the plate.

The model is trained on a large dataset of license plate images, augmented with various transformations andnoise to  enhance its robustness. To optimize the model various optimizations such as model compression, quantization, and hardware acceleration are applied to reduce the model's size and improve its speed.The proposed OCR model can be utilized in a wide range of applications such as traffic management, toll collection, and parking enforcement.
